A few
# words
to start with


You should
# know
containers
Note:
- This talk assumes familiarity with basic linux container
  concepts. You should know what a container is, and ideally you would
  have occasionally run a container. It doesn't really matter whether
  your experience has been with LXC, LXD, Docker or whatever.
- It is not for container novices.


You should
# know
high availability
Note:
- It also doesn't hurt if you've worked with high availability systems.
